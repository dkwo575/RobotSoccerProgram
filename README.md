# Robot Soccer Software
### Instruction
- There are many error such as version, configuration error, dependency error etc
- To figure out this error I will suggest this instruction.

1. Use Visual Studio rather than visual studio code. It is easier to compile.
2. This program was compiled in 32 bit, and we will compile this progam in 64 bit.
3. To figure out this, project -> properties -> configuration manager -> create x64 in solution platform
